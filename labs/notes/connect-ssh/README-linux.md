# Connect with SSH 

Using the SSH protocol, you can connect and authenticate to remote servers and services. With SSH keys, you can connect to CloudLab without supplying your username and personal access token at each visit.

When you set up SSH, you will need to generate a new SSH key and add it to the ssh-agent. You must add the SSH key to your account on CloudLab before you use the key to authenticate. For more information, see [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](generate-linux.md) and [Adding a new SSH key to your CloudLab account](add-cloudlab-linux.md).
