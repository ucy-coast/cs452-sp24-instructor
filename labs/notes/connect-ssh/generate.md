# Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent

After you've checked for existing SSH keys, you can generate a new SSH key to use for authentication, then add it to the ssh-agent.

Choose your platform and SSH client:

- [Linux](generate-linux.md)
- [MacOS](generate-macos.md)
- [Windows/OpenSSH](generate-windows-openssh.md)
- [Windows/MobaXterm](generate-windows-mobaxterm.md)
- [Windows/Putty](generate-windows-putty.md)
